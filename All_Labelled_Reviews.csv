Hi -,Other,Ethosuximide
"Hello Parents, Sorry for the long post",Other,Ethosuximide
 I thought I could share my story with you all,Other,Ethosuximide
My story might help answer some of the questions you have,Other,Ethosuximide
" When I started this long , difficult & tiring journey I was confused, looking for answers , scared to death",Other,Ethosuximide
 Let me start: In Sep 2009 my daughter (then 5 years) was diagnosed with Absence seizures,Other,Ethosuximide
I think it started somewhere in April 2009 but we thought it’s just a kids thing that she does,Other,Ethosuximide
Never imagined it would be this,Other,Ethosuximide
It initially started with she stopping her activities/talking in the middle for about 5-6 seconds and then being normal,Other,Ethosuximide
This happened 3-4 times  a week,Other,Ethosuximide
" After a couple of months, this started happening many times in a day but now she would stop for about 2-3 secs",Other,Ethosuximide
We thought its just a phase and she would get over it,Other,Ethosuximide
" When we took her to see her pediatrician for a routine checkup and mentioned it to her, she immediately sent her for an EEG",Other,Ethosuximide
And our worst fears came true,Other,Ethosuximide
 It was hard to come to terms with it and realize that my beautiful little one was having these since April and we did not do anything about it,Other,Ethosuximide
We were immediately sent to a pediatric neurologist and he started her on Ethosuximide,Other,Ethosuximide
He assured us that since she did not have any other neurological issues and did not have a family history she would outgrow it in a couple of years,Other,Ethosuximide
 She was started at 3tsp twice a day,Other,Ethosuximide
We started seeing a difference within 3 weeks,Effective,Ethosuximide
The frequency of episodes went down,Effective,Ethosuximide
Week 4: We did not see anything,Effective,Ethosuximide
We thought we had them in control,Effective,Ethosuximide
" But darn it, we were wrong",Ineffective,Ethosuximide
Week 5: we started seeing these sutle fluttering of eyelids where she would stop talking in between for about 2-3 secs and then be normal,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
They were definitely going down but were still there,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
The doctor increased the dose to 4 tsp twice a day,Other,Ethosuximide
The side-effects started in full swing with this increase in dosage,Adverse,Ethosuximide
She could not sleep,Adverse,Ethosuximide
She would get up every 2 hours and then be awake for 2 hours,Adverse,Ethosuximide
It was so difficult,Adverse,Ethosuximide
She absolutely could not get sleep,Adverse,Ethosuximide
This went on for 2-3 weeks,Other,Ethosuximide
We told the doctor,Other,Ethosuximide
" He said since the purpose of the medication is to gain 80% control over seizures and at this point since its not affecting her learning and since they have gone down, we could just keep her with the initial dosage",Effective,Ethosuximide
And she would outgrow it,Effective,Ethosuximide
"Hi Marisa, thank you for replying",Other,Ethosuximide
  On average my Son was having 20 plus a day before starting treatment,Other,Ethosuximide
  On some occasions it seemed like he had many more,Other,Ethosuximide
  Both my husband and I have definitely noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount he has now,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
  Although I noticed that the past three mornings he has had at least one before going to school and last night I noticed him to have a couple,Other,Ethosuximide
  They last just split seconds though,Other,Ethosuximide
  His before treatment never lasted more than probably 10 seconds,Other,Ethosuximide
  I am wondering if it is because he is getting back into a routine again with school and having to get up earlier than when he was on vacation over the Holiday's,Other,Ethosuximide
  He so far has had no reaction to the medication but maybe being a little more tired at evening time,Other,Ethosuximide
" I called his Neurologist to give her an update and she seemed to be comfortable that he was still having them and told me to wait a little longer, that this was typical",Other,Ethosuximide
  Were you told that these seizures would be outgrown,Other,Ethosuximide
Our Dr said that he would outgrow them and that after 2 years on treatment we would slowly take them off the medication,Other,Ethosuximide
  And also we are only scheduled to see her every 6 months for 2 years,Other,Ethosuximide
When she is tired it really has an effect on her,Adverse,Ethosuximide
  I have to make sure she gets enough sleep because then I notice more,Other,Ethosuximide
Greeting's!  Since I posted that my Son is now at 10ml am and pm and is still having a couple sz a day,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
He is at the limit for this medication and will have to switch to Depakote if they continue,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
  His Neuro ordered a 24 hour eeg to determine that he is indeed having sz's and nit just zoning out (daydreaming) because they do look different than before,Other,Ethosuximide
they are very brief and his eyes do not flutter like before,Effective,Ethosuximide
  So after that we will decide if Depakote is the best choice,Other,Ethosuximide
"  But about the nightmares, he has not mentioned having any",Effective,Ethosuximide
  He has in the past had them and wakes us up right away,Other,Ethosuximide
I know that this is a side effect of this particular drug but I am not sure if they go away,Adverse,Ethosuximide
My Son however does laugh a lot in his sleep,Adverse,Ethosuximide
  Just this past week he has woke me up twice literally laughing,Adverse,Ethosuximide
  He has no recollection of it in the morning,Other,Ethosuximide
  Wishing you the best of luck I know firsthand how frustrating this can all be,Other,Ethosuximide
  Take care,Other,Ethosuximide
Dawn,Other,Ethosuximide
Marisa,Other,Ethosuximide
My 5 year old son just started this medicine 2 weeks ago,Other,Ethosuximide
He has been going to the bathroom more frequently,Adverse,Ethosuximide
I am assuming this is a side effect,Adverse,Ethosuximide
I have too noticed him still having some episodes in the morning and at night when he is tired,Adverse,Ethosuximide
He started on 2ml for 7days now he is on 7ml and will increase to the full amount on Friday,Other,Ethosuximide
" Does anyone know the long term effects and if this medicine is not stopping them, then what do you do",Other,Ethosuximide
Thanks Jenn,Other,Ethosuximide
Hi,Other,Ethosuximide
"  My 7 year old daughter has been on Etho for about 8 weeks now and at first I noticed that the medicine really helped and she had a good couple of weeks with no seizures, but then they started up again and seemed to last a little longer",Ineffective,Ethosuximide
  Her Neuro told us that we just need to get her at the right dosage of medicine to get them under control and that may take a few months,Other,Ethosuximide
  So we're just on a schedule to slowly increase her Etho dosage and going in for EEG's to see how it's working,Other,Ethosuximide
  Hope that's helpful!!,Other,Ethosuximide
Hi my daughter was just diagnosed about 3-4 weeks ago,Other,Ethosuximide
She is on Etho>>>>>,Other,Ethosuximide
She has the axact story as you,Other,Ethosuximide
She is on day 17,Other,Ethosuximide
Is your child having nightmares,Other,Ethosuximide
" my daughter is, so i was wondering if you new if they would go away or not",Adverse,Ethosuximide
Dawn,Other,Ethosuximide
I am hoping this is it,Other,Ethosuximide
  Otherwise the doctor will add another medicine,Other,Ethosuximide
  Each time we get to a new dose I expect that this will be it,Other,Ethosuximide
  It can be nerve racking,Other,Ethosuximide
Shelly,Other,Ethosuximide
Welcome JMommy!!  Since my post my Son is continuing to have a few sz a day and we just had a 24 EEG done and the Dr has decided to switch to Depakote,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
  Our Dr wants complete control of his sz,Other,Ethosuximide
  My husband and I were very happy at the 80-90% decrease that we noticed but apparently the amount that he continues to have is too many,Effective,Ethosuximide
  My Son's appetite completely changed too,Adverse,Ethosuximide
"  But that lasted maybe three months, he has his appetite back!!!  I understand what you mean about seeing these changes in our kids",Effective,Ethosuximide
  Fortunately CAE is usually outgrown,Other,Ethosuximide
  I have read that there are cases where it developes into a different sz,Other,Ethosuximide
  I brought this concern up to our Neuro and she assured me that there is no reason Raymond will not outgrow these,Other,Ethosuximide
  She mentioned that children who suffer from other serious medical conditions tend to have sz that progress into GM,Other,Ethosuximide
  So I am hopeful that we will be on med's for a couple of years and be sz free after that!!  I wish you the best of luck with your Son,Other,Ethosuximide
"I have noticed a lot of the side effects from the Etjosuximide have gone away, it just takes time",Effective,Ethosuximide
"When he first started taking the Etho his seizures would stop, then they would start up again, and the doctor would raise the dose",Ineffective,Ethosuximide
"  And, that happened time after time",Other,Ethosuximide
  It would make me think that I forgot to give him his medicine,Other,Ethosuximide
  When I finally figured out the pattern I would make sure to call the doctor and have him adjust the dose,Other,Ethosuximide
  It shouldn't take more than 2 to 3 weeks for the dose to work if it is going to work,Other,Ethosuximide
I am so glad I found this site,Other,Ethosuximide
"  My 8 year old son was diagnosed with CAE on 4/8, and began Ethosuximide as I see most of your kids have",Other,Ethosuximide
"  My son decided to do the capsules (he stated that since he can swallow peas whole, after all ;-)",Other,Ethosuximide
  We are into week 2 at 2/250 mg capsules and will work up to 1000 mg in total,Other,Ethosuximide
" Evidence of his seizures had literally begun 3 days prior to his EEG, and although short in duration, it was evident that something strange was going on",Other,Ethosuximide
"  We are unsure how long these have been going on as he began to adjust to his ""lost moments"" (he called it daydreaming) and was able to maintain a perfect GPA with only a notation that he needs to pay better attention",Other,Ethosuximide
"  So here I am in week 2 and I need to keep reminding myself that the Ethosuxide is ultimately for his benefit - watching his appetite change before my eyes, including sudden dislike of foods that were once his favorites, the loose bowels, the nausea which we were able to stop for the most part by having him take his meds with milk and food",Adverse,Ethosuximide
  He has some sleep disturbances but that has pretty much been his MO for most of his life and has always awoken at least 1x per night,Adverse,Ethosuximide
  His doctor told us that he will have no restrictions (he plays a lot of sports and is very active) and aims to control 80% of the seizures,Other,Ethosuximide
"  I've also noted he is more fearful of stuff such as disease, for instance; he's always been a pretty deep kid, but stuff like mad cow disease that he just recently saw something on comes up now about once an hour (do you think these carrots are contaminated",Adverse,Ethosuximide
  the fruit snacks,Other,Ethosuximide
etc),Other,Ethosuximide
  It is just really painful to know your kid is on a mind altering drug see some of the no so great results,Adverse,Ethosuximide
"  I do want to end my rant on a high note though, and that is if we continue on our best case scenario, this will be a minor blip in his history and all in all, not a big deal",Other,Ethosuximide
  I am just a mom who is trying to maintain 100% demeanor while battling a not so welcome new neurosis,Other,Ethosuximide
"  As for some of the other posts, he is not having nightmares at this time, though I've seen that they termed  ""vivid dreams"" as a potential side effect",Adverse,Ethosuximide
Sounds familiar,Other,Ethosuximide
  Our soon to be 8yr old daughter has been on Etho for about 8 weeks too,Other,Ethosuximide
 The medicine diminished most but not all of her seizures immediately but since have increased,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
  Our Neuro is increasing her dosage from 7ml to 8ml twice per day,Other,Ethosuximide
"  Though she eats (not well) before taking the medicine, she has severe nausea and we're NOT sure how to help alleviate it",Adverse,Ethosuximide
  Any suggestions would be welcomed,Other,Ethosuximide
Thank you for your response,Other,Ethosuximide
  I spoke to my Son's Neuro today and she increased his dosage at bedtine to 7,Other,Ethosuximide
5ml so hopefully that will completely control his sz,Other,Ethosuximide
  She said wait a week and if they still continue then we will up both doses per day to 7,Other,Ethosuximide
5ml,Other,Ethosuximide
So I was happy that we are staying on Etho and not switching to something else,Other,Ethosuximide
  How many ml is your daughter currently on,Other,Ethosuximide
Raymond's Neuro said that we have room to increase even more before switching to another drug,Other,Ethosuximide
  So I was curious how much a child can go up to a day on this particular type of medicine,Other,Ethosuximide
  Thank you again for your reply,Other,Ethosuximide
My 7 year old daughter has been on this medicine for two months now,Other,Ethosuximide
  At first it completely stopped the seizures from what I could tell,Effective,Ethosuximide
  Now it seems like they are starting to come back,Ineffective,Ethosuximide
  Her doctors said that as long as the seizures are being cut down by like 80% they would be fine with that,Other,Ethosuximide
Our 8 yr old girl is on the maximum dose for her weight 8ml 2X / day but still has signs of seizing,Other,Ethosuximide
though considerably less than when she was on a lower or no dose of Etho,Other,Ethosuximide
"  Every time upon increasing her dosage, she would experience nightmares but they subsided within a week as well as her severe nausea",Adverse,Ethosuximide
"  That said, our neuro plans to change to depakote over the course of the next 10 days or so",Other,Ethosuximide
