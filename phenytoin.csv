I'd stay on Dilantin if I could but its too dangerous with Osteoporousis,Adverse
My VA neurologist and the VA agreed that I would continue to receive brand name dilantin because it is a cheap and effective drug anyway The only side effect I've really noticed is that it does affect your teeth and gums and therefore I go to the dentist three times a year instead of twice a year for cleaning and exams It is a great drug and I use it in combination with generic Keppra and haven't had a seizure since July 2004,Effective
