"""This has worked better than any other medicine I have used to treat mania",Effective
I only had slight fatigue when starting the medicine but it disappeared after a few weeks,Effective
"However, after the second dose, I noticed that my explosiveness was gone",Effective
My disproportionate rage to the event had disappeared,Effective
I love this medicine and will never get off of it,Effective
"I take 200mg twice a day, but it feels like it lasts around 6 hours in me",Ineffective
It's great! AND I don't feel drugged at all,Effective
It has been great,Effective
I have had two healthy children and maintained my medication during my pregnancies and had no problems,Effective
This drug worked but I continually had to keep increasing the dose from 200mg to 600mg and on occasion 800 to 900 on bad days,Effective
"Have found great success with this drug combined with an acupuncture regimen, this combo has stopped the continued progression/escalation of pain and has me living on about 600 mg daily sometimes as low as 400mg",Effective
The reduction has helped with drowsiness and I am not quite as scared regarding the continual progression/elevation of pain and meds,Effective
"I was put on 300 mgs twice a day and it didn't help at all and the attacks were just getting more severe and frequent, so the neurologist upped it to 900mgs a day",Ineffective
Still no relief! I have been on two other kinds and pretty much have to rely on pain medication which doesn't even relieve all the pain,Ineffective
"""I have been on carbamazepine for 17 years and find it keeps my mood stabilized and works best as an anti-manic",Effective
It is not much help with depression,Ineffective
"I had tried Lithium, Depakote, and a few of the atypical antipsychotics prior to carbamazepine and the thing I loved about this drug is I did not gain weight on it, in fact after coming off Depakote and on to this I lost 40 pounds",Effective
So for me it is weight neutral,Effective
"My serum sodium does run slightly low, and I am sometimes tired, but that is the mainstay with psychiatric drugs",Adverse
"The initial breaking in phase was rough, about 3 months to adjust to the medication, but with the weight loss after Depakote",Adverse
"""This medication is saving my life! It really stabilizes my mood",Effective
Before I started taking carbamazepine I would experience horribly crippling depression in the afternoons combined with very strong urges to self medicate with alcohol or narcotics,Effective
"Now I feel about the same all day, never really up and never really down",Effective
"I have only noticed two side effects: nausea, taking it with food fixes that, and increased sleep",Adverse
I sleep longer than I did before and wake up feeling tired,Adverse
"Actually it helps me to sleep through the night, which isn't all bad",Effective
I have found it to control my seizures very well,Effective
"I had initial fatigue, head aches, but they subsided after the first couple months",Effective
"The reason I rated it at 9 is because I have not tried any other drugs, primarily for fear of losing the control Tegretol provides currently",Effective
"""I found ever since I've been on tegretol my seizures have stopped""",Effective
"""Extreme fatigue, dark urine, yellow eyes, severe constipation",Adverse

"""I took Epitol for a while and loved it",Effective
"""I have been on Tegretol for only 2 weeks and it gave me much relief",Effective
Neurontin and Topomax did not work for me,Ineffective
