# DrugNeuroAnalytics

A system for processing text reviews of neurological drugs by employing ML algorithms to provide an overview of the effectiveness or adverse reactions in the form of an insightful and visually informative representation.

# Motivation

To help the patients in making an informed choice about the drugs they are about to take, by building a visually rich system summarising the information about the drug.

# Technologies used

* scikit-learn
* spacy
* nltk
* vaderSentiment
    
    The project was built on Google Colab's runtime environments.
    
# Journey

The technical process behind building this app was documented and written in Towards Data Science [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-machine-learning-can-help-identify-effectiveness-and-adverseness-of-a-drug-e23c7933c233).
The article also includes a part on building visualisations using Bokeh for effective comparison of drug reviews. The visualisation is shown here.
