"
but i love the calmness all theses side effects have gone away i feel like i am living like ive never lived this medicine is amazing",Effective
great medicine its the only one that stops the agitation that comes with being too manic for too long,Effective
it keeps me from crashing after mania because the mania never peeks,Effective
i have found though that taking both together by a doctors suggestion keeps the number of episodes pretty low,Effective
good medicine though,Effective
after trying topamax for months with no relief i have been on depakote er for three months with great relief,Effective
i was having migraine headaches 17 out of 31 days a month now maybe one a month taking axert when i have pain,Effective

didnt notice anything significant,Ineffective
however it did not help with mania mood swings,Ineffective
when i took it it didnt improve my moodswings that much,Ineffective
didnt really help me,Ineffective
depakote has done nothing at all to improve my migraines,Ineffective
i am not very fond of depakote,Ineffective
depakote didnt seem to do much with my mood swings,Ineffective
it didnt really help my headaches either,Ineffective
depakote is bad,Ineffective
we have seen several improvements in her symptoms but not enough to keep her on a medication that makes her gain weight and decreases her self esteem,Ineffective
horrible i was on it for a month and quit immediately,Ineffective
im not dulled out back to my normal serene self,Ineffective
that i just cant take it any more,Ineffective
wasnt for me,Ineffective
"his body was unable to handle the level of 
depakote",Ineffective
i will never take this medication even if it saved my life,Ineffective
the visual disturbances are constant,Ineffective
my eyes never adjust to the changes in light and everything becomes a huge swirling mass of shadows,Adverse
it sometimes pulses so quickly that it looks like a strobe light,Adverse
for me it is not worth it,Ineffective
laying down is excruciating and im in the process of running test,Adverse
i have to say some of side effects to depakote are tough but the side effects to my condition is could be way worse so ive been sticking to it working through the side effects,Effective
side effects headache staring head feels funny like a electric shock nauseous,Adverse
my lips tongue are twitching,Adverse
i would have given it a 10 but sometimes a little coffee can make me get manic even though i have taken the medicine,Ineffective
depakote has really helped to get me out of the fog of mania,Effective
i dont know about anyone else but sometimes when i get manic i spiral out of control and actually experience psychosis which is terrible,Adverse
both medicines stopped her gran mal and petit mal seizures,Effective
she is no longer a joyful and energetic child but has become very lethargic and depressed,Adverse
the only problem i have had is i have gained 10 pounds in less than three months,Adverse
i take 500 er twice a day and gained 16lbs in less than 3 weeks,Adverse
works wonders for my migraine but the side effects arent worth it,Ineffective
ive been on depakote er once at bedtime for only 6 weeks and it has cut my migraines in half,Effective

it helps with the intense mood swings negative emotions are less severe,Effective
i do not feel any side effects,Effective
i actually lost 25 pounds,Adverse
the only medication that clears up my head and makes me feel normal,Effective
also it gets rid of my migranes,Effective
the only bad thing is a few side effects,Adverse
and i was pretty lathargic at first,Adverse
i was off of it for a long time and recently was put back on it so going through side effects again but felt a difference rite away,Adverse
i have to say this drug did more harm then good and my body is very dependent on it,Adverse
i have never had any issues with my back but all of a sudden my bones started to get brittle,Adverse
then the disc herniations started happening and like a domino effect entire spine was damaged,Adverse
i see along of info on children or babies effected with their spine but apparently it can do the same for a grown adult,Adverse
great,Effective
damage done,Adverse
abnormal eeg,Adverse
lost my hair my looks weight,Adverse
severe pain all over after taking so i had to stop,Adverse
i was able to handle stress and forget that i have any depression,Effective
but on this stage after having stress my symptoms reuccured but was not severe as before,Effective

all of the meds i mentioned above do not help,Ineffective
im at my wits end,Ineffective
she has gained 28 pounds,Adverse
when the dose was upped to 1500mg she had daily migraines,Ineffective
it made me feel like a zombie all day but worked well on my swings from extreme anxiety to deep depression and crying spells,Adverse
i was very tired all day and had a hard time waking up for work so we reduced to 250mg daily,Adverse
i would also occasionally feel disconnected and distant from the world but this was rare,Adverse
i dont think i have many side effects from it besides maybe trouble losing weight im very active and eat well but never seemed to get any weight off,Adverse
i would also occasionally feel disconnected and distant from the world but this was rare,Adverse
on 1000 mg per day i am or have been somewhat stabilized which leaves me somewhat hypo manic which seems to be the best level for me,Effective
i say somewhat stabilized because i started to go hyper manic in the past 2 weeks have no idea why,Adverse
depakote makes me gain weight big time,Adverse
i also felt a little numb i missed my highs but it was better than being psychotic one minute and crying in another,Adverse
